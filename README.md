A Go library to deliberate using Majority Judgment.

We use a **score-based algorithm**, for performance and scalability.

Supports billions of judgments and thousands of proposals per poll, if need be.


## Installation

    go get -u github.com/mieuxvoter/judgment


## Usage

Say you have the following tally:

![Example of a merit profile](./docs/2-2-2-2-2_2-1-1-1-5_2-1-1-2-4_2-1-5-0-2_2-2-2-2-2.png)

You can compute out the majority judgment rank of each proposal like so:

```go

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/mieuxvoter/judgment"
)

func main() {

    poll := &(judgment.PollTally{
        AmountOfJudges: 10,
        Proposals: []*judgment.ProposalTally{
            {Tally: []uint64{2, 2, 2, 2, 2}}, // Proposal A   Amount of judgments received for each grade,
            {Tally: []uint64{2, 1, 1, 1, 5}}, // Proposal B   from "worst" grade to "best" grade.
            {Tally: []uint64{2, 1, 1, 2, 4}}, // Proposal C   Make sure all tallies are balanced, that is they
            {Tally: []uint64{2, 1, 5, 0, 2}}, // Proposal D   hold the same total amount of judgments.
            {Tally: []uint64{2, 2, 2, 2, 2}}, // Proposal E   Equal proposals share the same rank.
            // ‚Ä¶
        },
    })
    deliberator := &(judgment.MajorityJudgment{})
    result, err := deliberator.Deliberate(poll)

    if nil != err {
        log.Fatalf("Deliberation failed: %v", err)
    }
    
    // Proposals results are ordered like tallies, but Rank is available. 
    // result.Proposals[0].Rank == 4
    // result.Proposals[1].Rank == 1
    // result.Proposals[2].Rank == 2
    // result.Proposals[4].Rank == 3
    // result.Proposals[5].Rank == 4

}
```
